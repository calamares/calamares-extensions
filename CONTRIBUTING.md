# Contributing to Calamares Extensions

Welcome to Calamares! We're happy that you would like to add
something to Calamares -- by extending it!
This contribution guide is minimal:
all the **technical** parts of contributing to
Calamares Extensions are the same as [contributing to Calamares](https://github.com/calamares/calamares/CONTRIBUTING.md).


## Code of Conduct

The Calamares community -- of developers, translators, and downstream (distro) users --
aims to be courteous, professional, and inclusive. Harrassment, discriminatory
statements and abuse are not tolerated. In general, we apply the
[KDE Code of Conduct](https://www.kde.org/code-of-conduct/) and the
[GNOME Code of Conduct](https://wiki.gnome.org/Foundation/CodeOfConduct) (the
rules of decent behavior in both communities are pretty much the same).

> See the [CoC section on the wiki](https://github.com/calamares/calamares/wiki#code-of-conduct)
> for a longer text. To report a problem, please contact the maintainer,
> Adriaan de Groot, or the KDE Community Working Group.


## Join the Conversation

GitHub Issues are **one** place for discussing Calamares and its extensions if there are concrete
problems or a new feature to discuss.
Issues are not a help channel.
Visit Matrix for help with configuration or compilation.

Regular Calamares development chit-chat happens in a [Matrix](https://matrix.org/)
room, `#calamares:kde.org`. Responsiveness is best during the day
in Europe, but feel free to idle.
Matrix is persistent, and we'll see your message eventually.
